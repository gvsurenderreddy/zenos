# It would be possible to edit the initcpio configs, after which
# the images would have to be regenerated, but it is not so easy
# to know what the desired result is (whether pata or ide) and,
# for the mkinitcpio call, which kernel is affected, i.e. which
# preset to use - though maybe there would only be one preset,
# which could also be found by grep.

# and ide is wanted, and that pata is now the norml choice. However, the
# virgin state of /etc/mkinitcpio.conf has only ide ...
