Version 5.3.4
Removed warnings about kconfig (as this is no longer included in Arch kernels.
Added check for mkisofs on host at beginning of buildlive (if building iso).
Added check for syslinux on target at beginning of buildlive (if not using
GRUB).
Minor profile tweaks.

2008.05.15
Version 5.3.2, adjusted initscripts approach so that it doesn't require a
custom initscripts package. Now rc.sysinit and rc.shutdown are replaced (in
buildlive) by larch versions which are compatible with the standard versions.
When larch-live is installed, the standard functions will be replaced by
larch functions. On installation using larchin larch-live will be removed
so the behaviour reverts to standard Arch behaviour, although the rc scripts
have been changed. But in any case the originals are saved so that they can
be restored on installation with larchin.

Changed handling of pacman.conf slightly. When there is a pacman.conf in the
profile (base directory, not overlay), this will be copied to the working
directory and used by mklarch, even if there was already a version in the
working directory. The pacman.conf in the live system will be this version
if built using mklarch, otherwise the existing version. However an
'IgnorePkg' line is added for kernel26, aufs and initscripts. Packages
listed in the 'noupdate' file in the profile, will also be added. This
line will be removed on installation using larchin.

2008.04.27
Version 5.3.0, new initscripts approach, replacing functions in
/etc/rc.d/functions rather than replacing /etc/rc.sysinit and
/etc/rc.shutdown. At present this requires a custom initscripts package.

2008.04.21
Version 5.2.2, added usb2iso, a fairly primitive script to make an iso from
a larch usb-stick. It also works from a running larch system, but only on
systems with a lot of memory.

2008.04.05
version 5.2.1, slight reworking of overlay handling in profiles - now files
owned by root:root do not have to be in overlay.xpk, they can be held within
directory 'rootoverlay', and their ownership will be changed automatically.
Files to be copied to /.livesys at boot are now in larch/copy.
Added larchquit.py to larch-live - special larch quit/logout gui, allows
selecting session-save options and also autologin user before quitting desktop,
included it in xmini menu/panel.
Other tweaks to xmini profile.

2008.02.27
Incompatible changes. WARNING!
With version 5.2 the init system has changed, in particular a custom inittab
is now required, which means all old profiles are likely to fail (because of
the /etc/inittab in the overlay).
